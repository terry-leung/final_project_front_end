{"pid":2,"name":"Williams Overture III Digital Piano Mahogany Red","description":"The Williams Overture III digital piano gives you concert grand sounds in a size that won’t overtake your living room. To do so, Williams recorded a 10' 2ʺ Italian grand in a pro studio to capture the nuances of every single note. But that's just one sampled sound in the Williams Sound library—the Overture Ill has 171 distinct voices to explore. With 88 fully weighted keys and three pedals, you’ll get the same feel as an acoustic piano in a more versatile setup. ","image_url":"/p02.webp","price":9300.00,"stock":8}
